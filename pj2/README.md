# Project 2 ❌⭕ — TiciTakaTo (Tic-Tac-Toe)

## Overview
A multi-page, vanilla-JS Tic-Tac-Toe experience with fun intro screens, a timed match, and two modes:
**Player vs Player** and **Player vs Computer**. The game tracks turns, detects wins/ties, times the session, and
lets you restart or play again.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – multi-page flow.
- **CSS3** – layout and styling (`style/main.css`, `style/gstyle.css`, `style/falling.css`).
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – game logic, timers, AI, and inter-page navigation.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (Edge/Firefox/Chrome).
2. Click through the intro screens (high-five → falling → math 44) to reach the game.
3. Choose **Player vs Player** or **Player vs Computer**.
4. Click a square to place your piece. Use **Start/Restart** or **Play Again?** as needed.
