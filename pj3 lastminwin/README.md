# Project 3 üåê ‚Äî Sports Analytics Web App (Prototype)

## Overview
A front-end prototype exploring DOM, CSS, and `fetch()` with local JSON data. The concept is a sports analytics hub that could pull live data and news, and eventually use AI to help bettors make safer, data-driven picks. For now, it demonstrates page structure, navigation, local data loading, and a simple media section. 

## What‚Äôs Implemented (Current)
- **Index landing page** with custom styling and navigation.
- **About page** describing the idea and direction.
- **Local JSON fetch** (fake data) to render basic content without paid APIs.
- **Media section** embedding a live YouTube stream and showing dynamic time on the page. 

## Roadmap (Planned)
- **API integration** (soccer/odds/news) 
- **News feed** via RSS/Fetch (prior cloud/RSS attempt noted). 
- **AI assistant** (ChatGPT API) to summarize stats, flag value picks, and explain reasoning. 
- UI polish (‚Äúfix chicho‚Äù), more pages, and portfolio-ready finishing touches. 

## Tech Stack
- **HTML/CSS** for structure & layout
- **JavaScript** with `fetch()` for local JSON data
- **YouTube embed** for live video

- ## Known Limitations
- No paid soccer API connected yet; **fake JSON** is used for demos. 
- RSS/news integration was exploratory and not finalized. 
- AI features are planned but not wired up.
